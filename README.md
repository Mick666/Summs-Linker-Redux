This website is designed to assist with linking news summaries when working with the DB Platform at iSentia.

The linker will first split the inputted text on new lines, divide said text up into two arrays, one of links and one of summaries, then link the first link with the first summary and so on.

Several options can be tweaked depending on what the client is after, or depending on the required style of summary.
